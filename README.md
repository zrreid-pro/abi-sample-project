Welcome to my quick sample project for my interview for ABI Attachments.
It is a simple one-page site that compares the main qualities of chicken nuggets and displays the rankings in the form of labelled gauges.
I chose to forgo most of the visual aspects of the project in favor of the functional aspects as this is not an interview for a graphic artist.
Please enjoy viewing my opinions concerning mainstream chicken nuggets.

The frameworks used in this project are React through Vite as well as some Bootstrap and Tailwindcss that I was testing out.

The ways to view/run this project are either to pull the project and run it from an IDE or view it on Github pages if they have finished loading it.
